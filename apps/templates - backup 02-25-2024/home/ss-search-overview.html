                                <p>When it comes to search relevance, crowdsourcing can play a vital role, though it is usually important not to annoy your valued customers by constantly asking them for feedbacks. Fortunately, it is often possible to learn from your customers implicitly based upon their behaviors without having to bother them by explicitly asking for input. For example, if you are trying to find the best products to return for a given search, why not examine your google analytics data to determine which products other customers most often clicked on in response to the same query?.

                                <p>Every time a customer takes an action - whether it be issuing a search query, viewing a product from the search result, adding a product to cart, purchasing a product, or otherwise taking some action on the search results - this provides a signal of that userâ€™s intent. We can log each of these signals and then process them in order to learn insights about each customer, about groups of customers, and about an entire customer base. This demo introduces you to the power of leveraging user signals in order to fetch the most relevant search result for a given search keyword.</p>

                            </div>
                                <p>When building search engines, we have two high-level types of data - "content" and "signals". Most of the content we deal with is in the form of product attributes. These attributes can represent product names, skus, manufacturer, product description, search keyword fields, or any other type of information that we may want to search through. Product attributes usually contain fields mentioned before with some kind of text through which we can search and find relationships, along with additional fields representing other attributes related to the content (size, color, and so on).</p>
                                <p>"Signals", on the other hand, reflect how customers engage with the content. When someone issues a query, they receive a set of products with content. Perhaps they click on a result, add it to their shopping cart, purchase the product, or take other similar actions. We refer to these interactions as signals, and their defining characteristic is that they provide external insights that can be used to understand how your customers want to interact with your product catalog. Of course, those signals can also later be added to products along with the pre-existing content, and if you are building an application that allows for searching through the signals, those signals actually then become new content for that application. Notwithstanding that in some cases signals can also be treated as content depending on the use case, the point here is that there are two key sources of information we can use to improve search: the attributes of the products being searched upon (content), and the observed customer interactions with the products (signals).</p>
